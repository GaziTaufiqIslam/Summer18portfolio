        <h4>Hello, I am Gazi Taufiq. I love Typography and Soccer. As you may already have known that I am a UX 
          professional, working with startups and small business to create customer oriented products.</h4>
        <h4>I also consult a creative developmet studio called <a href="#">Discrete</a>, where I have to wear many hats.
        From facilitiating clients meetings to directing the creative processess across different projects, making 
      complex UX decisions, interacting with the marketing and the dev team,.. I manage it all. </h4> 
      <h4>As a student I have participated in many local challenges and competitions, and was fortunate 
        enough to win as many as three of them. During my freetime I tought middle schoolers algebra, science, learning techniques
        and how to code. That was an wonderful experience as I learned to think like them, while trying to understand
        how they think and what they want. I was able to learn the true value of empathy. Interacting with 
        young minds made me a relisient and  resolute towards my own dreams.
